# Bachelor Thesis

These are all the simulations used in my Bachelor thesis. There is a running time simulation supporting different evolutionary algorithms, such as the (mu+1)-EA and the (mu+1)-GA. There is also a Monte-Carlo simulaton to compute the population drift. Finally, there are some example results of the running time simulation.
