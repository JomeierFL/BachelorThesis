# Bachelor Thesis

These are all the simulations used in my Bachelor thesis.
There is a running time simulation (Running_Time.py) supporting different evolutionary algorithms, such as the (mu+1)-EA and the (mu+1)-GA. It outputs the data in a format compatible with http://iohprofiler.liacs.nl/. There are also some example results of the running time simulation.
Finally,there is a Monte-Carlo simulaton to compute the population drift (population_drift.py)
